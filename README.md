# Edinburgh-Bus-Visualiser-Ang
Plotting of Edinburgh's bus and tram network.

Queries the public bus and tram API Edinburgh, Scotland - and plots the results onto Google Maps. This provides an understanding of the sheer size of the Edinburgh transport network. 

This uses an Angular frontend, with a Node.js / Express backend.
